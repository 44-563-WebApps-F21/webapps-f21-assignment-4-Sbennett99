                Alexis ascends the throne and exiles
                Prince Paul Maraloffski, not to Siberia,
                but to Paris. Maraloffski joins the Nihilists 
                to kill Alexis. The task of assassinating the 
                Tsar is given to Vera. She must infiltrate the 
                palace, stab the Tsar and throw the dagger out 
                the window as a signal to Nihilist agents below. 
                If she does not, the agents will break in and 
                kill him. Vera is reluctant to kill the man she
                loves, though.

            PRINCE PAUL. "The family as subversive of true socialistic and communal
            unity is to be annihilated." Yes, President, I agree completely with
            Article 5. A family is a terrible incumbrance, especially when one is
            not married. (_Three knocks at the door._)

            VERA. Alexis at last!

            _Password._ Væ tyrannis!

            _Answer._ Væ victis!

            (_Enter MICHAEL STROGANOFF._)

            PRES.[8] Michael, the regicide! Brothers, let us do honour to a man who
            has killed a king.

            [9]VERA (_aside_). Oh, he will come yet.[9]

            PRES. Michael, you have saved Russia.

            MICH. Ay, Russia was free for a moment [10]when the tyrant fell, but the
            sun of liberty has set again like that false dawn which cheats our eyes
            in autumn.

            PRES. The dread night of tyranny is not yet past for Russia.

            MICH. (_clutching his knife_).[10] One more blow, and the end is come
            indeed.

            VERA (_aside_). One more blow! What does he mean? Oh, impossible! but
            why is he not with us? Alexis! Alexis! why are you not here?
