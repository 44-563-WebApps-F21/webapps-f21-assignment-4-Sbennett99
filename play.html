            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera;_or,_The_Nihilists#Act_III">
                Alexis ascends the throne and exiles
                Prince Paul Maraloffski, not to Siberia,
                but to Paris. Maraloffski joins the Nihilists 
                to kill Alexis. The task of assassinating the 
                Tsar is given to Vera. She must infiltrate the 
                palace, stab the Tsar and throw the dagger out 
                the window as a signal to Nihilist agents below. 
                If she does not, the agents will break in and 
                kill him. Vera is reluctant to kill the man she
                loves, though.
